# Lapis Lazuli Mirroring System
_Lapis Lazuli's Mirror didn't disappear; it just ascended into cyberspace._

LapisMirror is a plugin-based service that imports posted images on a specific subreddit,
exports the images onto a mirroring service, then replies with the mirror links.

Currently, Lapis imports from Tumblr and deviantart, and exports to imgur.

Better documentation to follow.
